        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring computer graphics programmer who spends a lot of his time reading about and working with computer graphics.<br>
            The technical aspects of everything involved in computer graphics inspires me and excites me.<br>
            <br>
            When I am not working on school work I can be found playing video games with my significant other, reading, mountain biking, or programming.<br>
            Outside of those activities I have also worked on and now host an open source project called, GW2 Tool Hub.<br>
            This was a passion project of mine in order to help give back to the wonderful community of Guild Wars 2 (Best game ever).<br>
            <br>
            It was nice to meet you. If you are curious about any of my projects please don't hesitate to visit the Creative Corner for<br>
            all my published updates.<br>
            <br>
            Take Care
